Things to do:

[ ] user interactions:
  [x] creating a textNode that can be selected and deselected
  [x] creating a general purpose click, doubleclick and move mechanism
  [x] double-click to create a text node at that location
  [x] presseing 'delete' will remove any added nodes
  [ ] allow each node to be re-sized
  [ ] making the text node editable properly

[ ] creating the data model
  [x] textNodes as array of nodes
  [ ] textNodes as a tree?

[ ] enable persistence
  [ ] save to local storage
  [ ] enable downloading json
  [ ] enable opening a json file
  [ ] ask to save the current file if there are any nodes

[ ] infiniteCanvas (mostly CSS?)
  [ ] start with a larger but fixed size canvas?
  [ ] enable scrolling

[ ] enable joining nodes together using lines
  [ ] separate tool?
  [ ] what will the data model look like?

[ ] enable alignment of textNodes
  [ ] align left, right and center
  [ ]


Goal is to get to a working prototype as quickly as possible
Be able to add nodes, arrange them and make them persist
then make them larger
then allow save/open
